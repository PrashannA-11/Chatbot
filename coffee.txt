The History of Coffee
Coffee originated in Ethiopia during the 9th century, when a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his
goats became energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. The earliest evidence of coffee
drinking appeared in 15th-century Yemen, where Sufi monks drank it to stay awake during
prayers.
Types of Coffee Beans
1. Arabica - The most popular variety, making up 60-70% of global production. Grows at high
altitudes and has a sweeter, more complex flavor.
2. Robusta - Hardier plants with higher caffeine content. Often used in espresso blends for its
strong, bitter taste.
Brewing Methods
- French Press: Steep coarse grounds for 4 minutes before pressing
